Beatstream is an app for streaming music from your computer to anywhere with a modern Web browser!
(Beatstream currently requires Ruby to be installed on your computer)

### Installation

    $ git clone --recursive git://github.com/Darep/Beatstream.git
    $ cd Beatstream
    $ bundle
    $ rake db:migrate
    $ cp config/initializers/music_paths.rb.sample config/initializers/music_paths.rb
    $ nano config/initializers/music_paths.rb
    -> Change 'music_path'
    $ rails console
    -> User.create(:username => 'you', :email => 'you@where.ever', :password => 'secret', :password_confirmation => 'secret')
    -> exit
    $ rails server -d

Open Chrome and surf to http://0.0.0.0:3000 address. Log in and wait when indexing ends, refresh page and happy listening!


### Known issues

**HTTPS/SSL:** When running in production environment, the app forces SSL on. To disable this, change `config.force_ssl` in `config/environments/production.rb` to false and it shouldn't redirect to https.

**Last.fm:** You need to manually go to `https://localhost:3000/settings` and do the authentication there.

**Media Library:** Opens a blank page after refresh is done. Just go back, and start listening :)

**Flash/Firefox crash:** Beatstream's Flash plugin (SoundManager2) crashes sometimes. Restart browser / Flash.

**UTF-8 problems:** Sometimes song info looks garbled. Sometimes Beastream can't play songs with funny characters in filenames or paths.

**Endlessly spinning loader:** You probably have a Flash block of some kind. Allow Beatstream to use Flash.
